# Real-Time Collaborative Text Editor

#Work in Progress

This project implements a real-time collaborative text editor using Node.js, TypeScript, React, and WebSockets. It enables multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously, with changes reflected instantly across all connected clients.

## Features

* **Real-time Collaboration:** Users can edit the document simultaneously, seeing edits reflected instantly.
* **Syntax Highlighting (Optional):** Enhance code readability with syntax highlighting for various programming languages (implementation depends on chosen library).
* **Code Completion (Optional):** Offer relevant code suggestions to users as they type (implementation depends on chosen library).
* **Persistent Sessions (Optional):** Allow users to rejoin a session and continue collaborating without losing progress (requires backend storage).
* **User Management (Optional):** Implement user authentication and access control for collaborative sessions (requires backend authentication).

## Technologies

* **Frontend:** React (with TypeScript)
* **Backend:** Node.js (with TypeScript)
* **Communication:** WebSockets
